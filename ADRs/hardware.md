## Summary
This ADR aims to identify the hardware components necessary to play the mobile game Cyber Strike, focusing on optimizing the gaming experience and ensuring compatibility with the game's design.

### Issue
The development team needs to determine the essential hardware requirements for playing Cyber Strike, considering factors such as game play mechanics and user interaction.

### Decision
After evaluating the game's requirements and considering the desired gaming experience, the development team has identified the gyroscope sensor as the primary hardware requirement for playing Cyber Strike. 

### Status
Accepted

## Details

### Assumptions
1. Players will primarily use smartphones to play Cyber Strike.
2. The game is designed for landscape mode orientation.
3. Players will not require external peripherals such as keyboards or mice for game play.
4. Cyber Strike does not include any sound effect or music tracks at this time.

### Constraints
1. The game must run smoothly on devices with varying hardware capabilities.
2. The hardware requirements should not exceed the capabilities of typical mid-range Android devices.

### Positions
Gyroscope Sensor: Enables landscape mode orientation and provides a better layout for the design of Cyber Strike.

No Internet Connection: The game does not rely on internet connectivity for game play, ensuring offline accessibility and reducing dependency on network infrastructure.

### Argument
The gyroscope sensor is essential for enabling landscape mode orientation, which is optimal for Cyber Strike's intuitive game play.Additionally, requiring no internet connection aligns with the game's design as a single-player experience, ensuring players can enjoy uninterrupted game play sessions regardless of their internet connectivity status.

### Implications
1. Players can enjoy Cyber Strike's game play in landscape mode, enhancing immersion and ease of control.
2. Offline accessibility ensures that players can enjoy the game without being dependent on internet connectivity, making it suitable for various gaming environments.
3. The game's hardware requirements may limit compatibility with certain devices that lack a gyroscope sensor or internet connectivity, potentially affecting the target audience.
